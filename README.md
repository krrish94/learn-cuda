# learn-cuda
A collection of scripts I wrote when learning CUDA C++ programming.


## Code examples

### 1D Convolution
Performs 1D convolution. TODO: Add stride, dilation, arbitrary input size support

### 2D Convolution
TODO

### Tiled Matrix Multiplication
Basic version in here

### 1D Stencil
Takes in a 1D array and applies a 'stencil' operation (similar to convolution), but for integer arrays.

### Using both Threads and Blocks
Vector addition split across threads as well as blocks.

### Introduction to Threads
Vector addition parallelized across threads.

### Introduction to Blocks
Vector addition parallelized across blocks.

### Hello CUDA
Launches a CUDA kernel that practically does nothing.
